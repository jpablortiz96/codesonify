> **Every line of code has a melody.** CodeSonify transforms source code into real music. Functions become melodies, loops become rhythms, conditionals become chord changes, and bugs sound dissonant. Export to MIDI, sonify git diffs, and hear the evolution of your codebase — all integrated into GitHub Copilot via MCP.

## 🌟 Features

### 🎵 Code → Music Engine
Paste any code — JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, Go, Rust — and hear it as music. Each programming construct maps to a distinct musical element:

| Code Structure | Musical Element | Why |
|---------------|----------------|-----|
| **Functions** | Ascending melodic phrases | Functions are the building blocks — they create the melody |
| **Loops** | Repeating rhythmic patterns | Loops repeat — just like rhythm |
| **Conditionals** | Harmonic chord changes | `if`/`else` creates branching paths — like harmonic tension and resolution |
| **Variables** | Deep bass notes | Variables are the foundation — like bass in music |
| **Classes** | Power chords | Classes are structures — rich, layered chords |
| **Comments** | Ambient pads | Comments are the quiet spaces between the code |
| **Errors** | Dissonant clusters | Bugs should sound bad — because they are |
| **Nesting depth** | Octave (pitch) | Deeper nesting = higher pitch = more tension |
| **Complexity** | Tempo (BPM) | Complex code plays faster and more intensely |
| **Language** | Musical key | Each language has its own key signature |

### 🎹 MIDI Export
Export any sonification as a **real .mid file** that opens in GarageBand, FL Studio, Ableton, Logic Pro, or any DAW. Your code becomes real, editable, shareable music.

### 🔄 Diff Sonification
Sonify git diffs and code changes:
- **Added lines** → Bright, ascending melodies in major key
- **Removed lines** → Dark, descending bass in minor key
- **Context** → Soft ambient background
- Hear a refactoring as a musical journey from tension to resolution

### 🎨 5 Musical Styles
| Style | Key | Character |
|-------|-----|-----------|
| 🎻 Classical | C Major | Elegant, sine/triangle waves |
| 🎹 Electronic | A Minor | Driving, square/sawtooth waves |
| 🌊 Ambient | D Pentatonic | Dreamy, heavy reverb |
| 🎷 Jazz | F Dorian | Warm, swing feel |
| 🎸 Rock | E Blues | Aggressive, distorted |

### 🔧 MCP Server — 5 Tools for GitHub Copilot
CodeSonify integrates directly into **VS Code via MCP**, giving GitHub Copilot 5 powerful tools:

| # | Tool | What it does |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | `sonify_code` | Transform any code into a full musical composition |
| 2 | `analyze_code_structure` | Get code metrics: complexity, functions, nesting, loops |
| 3 | `compare_code_musically` | Compare two code snippets by their musical output |
| 4 | `sonify_git_diff` | Turn git diffs into music — hear your code reviews |
| 5 | `export_midi` | Export code as a real MIDI file for music production |

### 🌐 Web Application
A polished, real-time web interface featuring:
- **Code editor** with syntax highlighting
- **Real-time canvas visualization** with animated note particles
- **Live audio playback** using Tone.js Web Audio synthesis
- **Stats dashboard** showing tempo, key, complexity, notes, duration, tracks
- **Track breakdown** with per-instrument volume bars
- **Musical interpretation** — human-readable description of what the music represents
- **Diff Mode** — compare old vs new code versions visually and musically
- **MIDI download** — one-click export to .mid file

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) (for MCP integration)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/codesonify.git
cd codesonify

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the web application
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. Paste code, pick a style, and click **Sonify Code**. 🎵

### Using the MCP Server with GitHub Copilot

1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Open `.vscode/mcp.json` — click the **"Start"** button that appears
3. Open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) → switch to **Agent Mode**
4. Try these prompts:

```
Sonify this code: function fibonacci(n) { if (n <= 1) return n; return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2); }
```

```
Analyze the code structure of my current file
```

```
Export this as MIDI: const greet = (name) => console.log(`Hello ${name}`)
```

```
Sonify the diff between these: 
Old: "function add(a,b) { return a+b; }"  
New: "const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;"
```

## 🤖 GitHub Copilot Usage

GitHub Copilot was instrumental throughout the entire development of CodeSonify. Here's how AI-assisted development shaped this project:

### 🧠 Architecture & Design (Copilot Chat)
- Brainstormed the mapping between programming constructs and musical elements
- Designed the TypeScript type system with 40+ types for code analysis and music composition
- Explored which musical scales best represent each programming language
- Debugged audio timing issues with Tone.js Web Audio API

### ⚡ Code Acceleration (Copilot Suggestions)
- Auto-completed musical scale definitions (major, minor, pentatonic, blues, dorian, mixolydian, lydian, chromatic)
- Generated Express route handlers with input validation
- Suggested the canvas visualization algorithm for animated note particles
- Completed the MIDI binary format implementation (variable-length quantities, track chunks)

### 🎨 Creative Exploration
- Used Copilot to explore different approaches to code complexity scoring
- Generated example code snippets that showcase diverse musical outputs
- Helped design the diff-to-music mapping logic (ascending = additions, descending = deletions)

### 🔧 MCP Server Development
- Copilot Chat helped structure the MCP tool definitions with proper Zod schemas
- Generated the formatted markdown output for each tool response
- Assisted with the comparison table formatting in `compare_code_musically`
